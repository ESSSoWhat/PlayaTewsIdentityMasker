# Final Test Report - UI Relocation Migration

## Test Summary
✅ **All tests passed successfully**

## Issues Resolved

### 1. DynamicSingleSwitch.Worker() Issue
- **Problem**: VoiceChanger backend was trying to use `DynamicSingleSwitch.Worker()` which doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Changed all `.Worker()` calls to `.Host()` calls in the VoiceChanger Sheet.Worker class
- **Files Modified**: `apps/PlayaTewsIdentityMasker/backend/VoiceChanger.py`

### 2. NumPy Deprecation Issue
- **Problem**: `np.int` and `np.float` are deprecated in newer NumPy versions
- **Solution**: Removed deprecated `np.int` and `np.float` from type checking
- **Files Modified**: `xlib/mp/csw/Number.py`
