## üîç How to Identify Real Models

### File Characteristics:
- **Extension**: `.dfm`
- **Size**: 50-200MB (typically 100-150MB)
- **Format**: Binary files (not text/JSON)
- **Content**: ONNX-based neural network models

### Red Flags:
- Files smaller than 10MB (likely placeholders)
- Files with `.json` extension (not real models)
- Files that open as text (should be binary)

## üì• Installation Process

### Step 1: Download
1. Find and download the `.dfm` file
2. Ensure it's the correct size (50-200MB)
3. Verify it has `.dfm` extension

### Step 2: Install
```bash
python quick_dfm_setup.py
```
Then enter the path to your downloaded file.

### Step 3: Verify
1. Check that the file appears in both directories:
   - `dfm_models/[model_name].dfm`
   - `universal_dfm/models/prebuilt/[model_name].dfm`
2. Restart the PlayaTewsIdentityMasker app
3. Models should appear in the dropdown

## üöÄ Quick Start Recommendations

1. **Start with 1-2 models** (e.g., Keanu_Reeves, Bryan_Greynolds)
2. **Test them** in the app to ensure they work
3. **Download more** as needed
4. **Replace placeholders** gradually
