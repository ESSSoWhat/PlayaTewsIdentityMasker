- Placeholder files are **<1KB** (JSON text files)
- If you see a small file, it's a placeholder, not a real model

### Security:
- Only download from trusted sources
- Scan downloaded files with antivirus
- Avoid suspicious or unofficial sources

### Performance:
- Larger models (150-200MB) usually have better quality
- Smaller models (50-100MB) may be faster but lower quality
- Test models before using in production
