# Security and Accessibility Improvements - Summary

## High-Priority Improvements Implemented

### 1. Security Hardening ✅ COMPLETED

**New Module: `security_validator.py`**
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Path traversal protection
- Command injection prevention
- File type and size validation
- Model file security checks
- JSON input validation
- URL security validation

**Key Security Features:**
- Validates filenames, file paths, JSON input, and URLs
- Prevents access to system directories (`/etc`, `/var`, `/proc`)
- Sanitizes dangerous characters and patterns
- Validates file extensions and sizes for different operations
- Checks model file headers and integrity

### 2. Accessibility Support ✅ COMPLETED

**New Module: `accessibility_manager.py`**
- Screen reader support with announcement system
- Full keyboard navigation with focus management
- High contrast mode toggle
- Large text mode for better readability
- Voice feedback for important events
- Persistent accessibility settings

**Key Accessibility Features:**
- Tab navigation between focusable elements
- Function key shortcuts (F1-F5)
- Focus indicators and tracking
- Error announcements for screen readers
- Configurable accessibility preferences

### 3. Enhanced Error Recovery ✅ COMPLETED

**New Module: `enhanced_error_recovery.py`**
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Automatic healing mechanisms
- Health checks and monitoring
- Recovery metrics tracking
- Multiple recovery strategies

**Key Recovery Features:**
- Circuit breakers for GPU, memory, network, and file operations
- Auto-healing for memory cleanup, GPU reset, process restart
- Health monitoring for system resources
- Graceful degradation during failures
- Comprehensive error tracking and reporting

## Integration and Usage

### Security Usage
```python
from security_validator import validate_file, validate_input

# Validate file upload
success, message = validate_file(filepath, "image")

# Validate user input
success, sanitized = validate_input(user_input, "json")
```

### Accessibility Usage
```python
from accessibility_manager import announce, register_focusable_element

# Announce events
announce("Application started successfully")

# Register UI elements
register_focusable_element("button1", "button", "Start processing")
```

### Error Recovery Usage
```python
from enhanced_error_recovery import execute_with_recovery

# Execute with recovery
success, result = execute_with_recovery("gpu_operation", gpu_function)
```
